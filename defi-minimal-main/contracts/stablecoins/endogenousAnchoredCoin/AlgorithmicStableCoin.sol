// This would be similar to a UST/LUNA

// This is considered an Endogenous, Decentralized, Reflexive, Crypto Collateralized low volitility coin

// Collateral: Endogenous
// Minting (Stability Mechanism): Decentralized (Algorithmic)
// Value (Relative Stability): Anchored (Pegged to USD)
// Collateral Type: Crypto

// Sometimes just refered to as "Algorithmic Stablecoin" since it uses endogenous collateral

// But maybe a better name would be EndoDrCCoin (EndoDocCoin?), or maybe like "RobertsCoin" or something after the Sam Roberts paper...
// We should fix the name as a community
